          <h4 class="newsauthor">BY RUSS BELVILLE · TUE APR 01, 2014</h4>
          <p class="newsbody"><span class="newssection">Blowing off your responsibilities:</span><br>
                             Being a responsible cannabis consumer means your personal use of marijuana doesn’t negatively affect fulfilling your responsibilities at work, at school, and as a parent, roommate and spouse. When you repeatedly call in sick, skip school or disappoint someone who was counting on you because you would rather get high, you’re not just sandbagging your own life, you’re contributing to the negative stereotypes about pot smokers that impact all of us and our ability to fight for legalization.<br>

                              <span class="newssection">Can’t shake that wheezing cough:</span><br>
                              While marijuana smoking isn’t the deadly dangerous gateway to heroin the drug warriors say it is, it is the inhalation of smoke.  You’re not likely to risk lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease like a cigarette smoker, but frequent, heavy marijuana use by smoking can lead to an irritated throat and lungs. Consider switching to vaporization or using edibles until your lungs can recover.<br>

                              <span class="newssection">Scraping resin from your bowl:</span><br>
                              We’ve all been there -- out of weed and none to be found -- so we take a pocket knife to the pipes and bongs and scrape up as much resin as possible to smoke. Unfortunately, what remains in resin after a bud has&#8230;

          <h3 class="newstitle">Obama Administration: We'll Work with Congress to Reschedule Marijuana</h3>
          <h4 class="newsauthor">BY MIKE HUGHES · FRI APR 04, 2014</h4>
          <p class="newsbody"><br>
                             Attorney General Eric Holder revealed that the Obama administration is willing to work with Congress to reschedule marijuana. Cannabis is currently a Schedule I narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act – along with heroin and LSD. Schedule I is reserved for drugs that have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical value.<br><br>

                              “We’d be more than glad to work with Congress if there is a desire to look at and reexamine how the drug is scheduled,” Holder said during a House Appropriations Committee hearing on Friday.<br><br>

                              “It is something that ultimately Congress would have to change, and I think that our administration would be glad to work with Congress if such a proposal were made.”<br><br>

                              What Holder didn’t mention is that the attorney general has the power to reschedule or remove a drug entirely from the schedules without Congressional support. However, it appears the administration is unwilling to reclassify pot&#8230;

          <p class="newsbody"><br>
                             Talk about a burrito with everything. A pair of Central Mississippi Correctional Facility guards were busted for allegedly attempting to smuggle contraband into prison via some very unique methods, including hiding tobacco in a foot-long sub and packing pot inside three burritos.<br><br>

                              Arrested separately last week, Erling Gresham, 26, and Tamikta Russell, 34, are both charged with “possession of prohibited items by persons other than offenders.” If convicted, the officers could face a $1,000 fine and up to a year in prison. Gresham would have made $200 if he successfully smuggled in nearly three ounces of tobacco to an inmate.<br><br>

                              Russell is also charged with possession of marijuana and introduction of contraband. According to reports Russell allegedly filled three burritos with a total of 48.7 grams of marijuana wrapped in plastic bags – along with over six ounces of tobacco. Under Mississippi’s harsh cannabis laws, Russell faces a fine of up to $25,000 and 3-7 years in prison with no possibility of parole<br><br>

                              Introducing contraband into a correctional facility also carries&#8230;
